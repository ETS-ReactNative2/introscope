# EffectsLogger

Side effect snapshoting tool for Introscope.

It's a snapshot powered variant of [redux-saga-test-plan](https://github.com/jfairbank/redux-saga-test-plan). EffectsLogger perfectly fits [Introscope](..) by automating functions mocking and spying. Based on code and ideas from [TestPlan](https://github.com/peter-leonov/test-plan).
