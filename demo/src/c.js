remembering the function response for the first time and then repeating it

record to a kinda effects logger to reproduce the order of returning say Date.now() calls

if the wrong function gets called then effects logger will show the diff a special exception gets thrown, the call order and arguments checking is still on the normal effectsLogger snapshot mechanism
